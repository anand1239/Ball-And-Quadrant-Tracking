# Ball-And-Quadrant-Tracking

This is an AI/ML model based on YOLO that processes a video or stream of frames as input. The video is divided into four quadrants, and users can place balls of various colors in any quadrant. Multiple balls can appear in a single frame. Users can also move the balls from one quadrant to another or completely remove them from the video frame. The model first identifies the color of each ball, records its quadrant location, and tracks whether the ball moves between quadrants or exits the frame. This movement is also handled by the model.
